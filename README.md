Projects written in C++ in the Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis course in Bogazici University, Fall 2016

## Big Integer
Program to compute arithmetic operations with integer numbers that are too big to be stored as 'int' type.

## D.E.S.
A discrete event simulation, including task-scheduling for CPU

## Graph-Longest Path
Solves the minimum time need to solve a squence of CPU works, which are related prerequisitively one another. Representation is based on graph theory and solution is found by finding the longest path in the graph
