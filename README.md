# cmpe250
Projects written in C++ in the Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis course in Bogazici University, Fall 2016

## project 1 - Big Integer
Program to compute arithmetic operations with integer numbers that are too big to be stored as 'int' type.

## project 2 - D.E.S.
A discrete event simulation, including task-scheduling for CPU

## project 3 - Graph-Longest Path
Computes the minimum time need to solve a squence of CPU works, which are related prerequisitively one another. Representation is based on graph theory and solution is found by finding the longest path in the graph

## project 4 - Graph-Kruskal
Using Kruskal's algorithm, finds the minimum weighted edge between two vertices such that both would lie on disjoint sets after cutting this edge

## project 5 - Graph-A*
An implementation of A-star algorithm for shortest path
